    $card2 = Games::Cards::Pair::Card->new({ value => 'Joker' });
    print "Card are the same.\n" if $card1->equal($card2);

=cut

sub equal {
    my ($self, $other) = @_;

    return 0 unless (defined($other) && (ref($other) eq 'Games::Cards::Pair::Card'));

    return 1
        if ((defined($self->{value}) && ($self->{value} =~ /Joker/i))
            ||
            (defined($other->{value}) && ($other->{value} =~ /Joker/i))
            ||

    return 0;
}

=head2 as_string()

Returns the card object in readable format. This is overloaded as string context for printing.

    print "Card: $card\n";
    # or
    print "Card: " . $card->as_string() . "\n";

=cut

sub as_string {
    my ($self) = @_;
